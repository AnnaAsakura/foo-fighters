            <h3> Early Life </h3>
            <p> Grohl was born on January, 14, 1969, in Warren, Ohio. His family then moved to Springfield, Virginia. Three years after moving here, his parents divorced and so Grohl grew up with his mother. At the age of 12, Grohl experimented with the guitar and took some guitar lessons but lost interest in them. After he went to stay with his cousin for a while, he was influenced by punk rock and built a great interest in this genre. He began playing drums in the 1980s and played for punk rock bands in Washington, DC area. Among his first bands was Freak Baby, which later came to be known as Mission Impossible and later changed again to Fast. When this band broke up, he joined Dain Bramage, but when he heard of the Scream band auditions he went to try his luck. Surprisingly he passed and at 17, Grohl became the drummer for Scream. Grohl dropped out of high school and toured with the band throughout the U.S. in 1987 and later in Europe. </p>

            <p> In 1990 when Scream disbanded abruptly, Grohl joined Nirvana who had already released their first album, Bleach. Grohl soon started working with the group to produce a follow up album Nevermind. Nevermind become an instant hit, breaking into the top of the charts world wide and catapulting Nirvana’s popularity on an instance.<br>

            </br> But even with the success, Grohl didn’t feel secure at Nirvana. He felt that he was just another drummer who can be replaced anytime. He was a songwriter too, but didn’t feel compelled to introduce his songs to the group. Rather, he thought it wise to let the band flow with their trend and therefore compiled his songs in an album called Pocket Watch, which he released in 1992. But the cassette was released under a pseudonym, Late! Nirvana went on to release Incesticide, which was a collection of B-sides and demos, and then came In Utero, released on September 21, 1993, and widely considered to be Nirvana's masterpiece. But following the death of Kurt Cobain, the band disbanded. </p>
