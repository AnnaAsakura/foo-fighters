    			<p> Georg Ruthenberg was born on August 5th 1959, and raised in West Los Angeles, to a mother of African-American and Native American descent, and a German immigrant father. His parents forced him to take piano lessons at a young age, and a few years later, he began teaching himself to play the guitar. He lists his influences as Joan Jett, Brian James, Brian May, and Steve Jones. </p>

    		<div class="earlylife2">
    			<p> As a teenager in 1977, Smear met Darby Crash, and together they formed The Germs with bassist Lorna Doom and drummer Dottie Danger (the pseudonym of Belinda Carlisle, who went on to front The Go-Go's).<br>

				</br> Carlisle was soon replaced by Don Bolles and, in 1979, the band released their first album, (GI). Produced by Joan Jett, the record is now defined as a milestone in the history of punk rock. The Germs endured for one more year before finally disbanding in 1980 after Crash committed suicide. After The Germs, Smear had a brief stint as a member of punk band The Adolescents. </p>
