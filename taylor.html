    		</div>

    		<div class="earlylifep">
    			<p> Hawkins was born on February 17, 1972 in Fortworth, Texas. He grew up in Laguna Beach, a seaside resort with an artistic community in California. He enjoyed surfing, but his passion was drumming. While still a youth, Hawkins was greatly influenced by Roger Taylor of Queen and Stewart Copeland, a drummer for Police. Copeland is known for his energetic and innovative drumming style and his ability to include reggae tastes to the songs. </p>

    			<p> Hawkins started playing drums while still a child. His best friend Drew Hester is a drummer too and the two would spend a lot of time in the house writing and playing songs together. But his first work with any band came with a band called Sylvia. Sylvia didnâ€™t last long since it was just an experimental band and so it quickly disbanded. After that, Hawkins went on play with Alanis Morissette. Morrissette, a Canadian singer and song writer needed a band that would tour with her to promote her album Jagged Little Pill. She therefore settled for Hawkins who played drums and also sang as a back up singer. </p>
