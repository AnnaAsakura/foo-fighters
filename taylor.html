    			<h3> Early Life </h3>
    		</div>

    		<div class="earlylifep">
    			<p> Hawkins was born on February 17, 1972 in Fortworth, Texas. He grew up in Laguna Beach, a seaside resort with an artistic community in California. He enjoyed surfing, but his passion was drumming. While still a youth, Hawkins was greatly influenced by Roger Taylor of Queen and Stewart Copeland, a drummer for Police. Copeland is known for his energetic and innovative drumming style and his ability to include reggae tastes to the songs. </p>

    			<p> Hawkins started playing drums while still a child. His best friend Drew Hester is a drummer too and the two would spend a lot of time in the house writing and playing songs together. But his first work with any band came with a band called Sylvia. Sylvia didn’t last long since it was just an experimental band and so it quickly disbanded. After that, Hawkins went on play with Alanis Morissette. Morrissette, a Canadian singer and song writer needed a band that would tour with her to promote her album Jagged Little Pill. She therefore settled for Hawkins who played drums and also sang as a back up singer. <br>

    			</br> Hawkins ended up leaving Morissette's band after a couple of years worth of recording and touring because, as he said on the Triple M podcast, he felt like he wasn't going to mesh well with the style Morissette was moving towards. He wanted to play harder, and she wanted to mellow out. Either way, it turned out well for Hawkins. </p>

				<h3> Foo Fighters </h3>

			<div class="foo1">
				<p> After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a Seattle studio with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. Conflict during studio recording reportedly erupted between Dave Grohl and drummer William Goldsmith, eventually causing Goldsmith to leave the band. The band regrouped in Los Angeles and almost completely re-recorded the album with Grohl on drums. The album, The Colour and the Shape, was released on May 20, 1997. Grohl called up Hawkins to recommend a new drummer, thinking that Hawkins would not leave Alanis Morissette since it's a bigger band compared to Foo Fighters, which was only starting at the time. But to Grohl's surprise, Hawkins volunteered himself, explaining that he wanted to be a drummer in a rock band, not a solo act which Alanis Morissette is. He then auditioned for and subsequently joined the band. On March 18, 1997, Hawkins' joining of the band was announced. Hawkins made his debut in time for the album's release. </p>
