    			<h3> Early Life </h3>
    		</div>

    		<div class="earlylifep">
    			<p> Hawkins was born on February 17, 1972 in Fortworth, Texas. He grew up in Laguna Beach, a seaside resort with an artistic community in California. He enjoyed surfing, but his passion was drumming. While still a youth, Hawkins was greatly influenced by Roger Taylor of Queen and Stewart Copeland, a drummer for Police. Copeland is known for his energetic and innovative drumming style and his ability to include reggae tastes to the songs. </p>
    		</div>


			<div class="earlylife2">
    			<p> Hawkins started playing drums while still a child. His best friend Drew Hester is a drummer too and the two would spend a lot of time in the house writing and playing songs together. But his first work with any band came with a band called Sylvia. Sylvia didn’t last long since it was just an experimental band and so it quickly disbanded. After that, Hawkins went on play with Alanis Morissette. Morrissette, a Canadian singer and song writer needed a band that would tour with her to promote her album Jagged Little Pill. She therefore settled for Hawkins who played drums and also sang as a back up singer. <br>

    			</br> Hawkins ended up leaving Morissette's band after a couple of years worth of recording and touring because, as he said on the Triple M podcast, he felt like he wasn't going to mesh well with the style Morissette was moving towards. He wanted to play harder, and she wanted to mellow out. Either way, it turned out well for Hawkins. </p>

				<h3> Foo Fighters </h3>
			</div>

			<div class="foo1">
				<p> After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a Seattle studio with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. Conflict during studio recording reportedly erupted between Dave Grohl and drummer William Goldsmith, eventually causing Goldsmith to leave the band. The band regrouped in Los Angeles and almost completely re-recorded the album with Grohl on drums. The album, The Colour and the Shape, was released on May 20, 1997. Grohl called up Hawkins to recommend a new drummer, thinking that Hawkins would not leave Alanis Morissette since it's a bigger band compared to Foo Fighters, which was only starting at the time. But to Grohl's surprise, Hawkins volunteered himself, explaining that he wanted to be a drummer in a rock band, not a solo act which Alanis Morissette is. He then auditioned for and subsequently joined the band. On March 18, 1997, Hawkins' joining of the band was announced. Hawkins made his debut in time for the album's release. </p>

			<div class="foo2">
				<p> When Hawkins joined the band, they were only playing at clubs or opening slots for other bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Now they have been touring for nearly 25 years, playing at sold-out stadium concerts. Their biggest concert was reportedly a two-night sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium in London, where they performed for approximately 86,000 people in 2008. </p>

				In addition to his drumming duties with the Foo Fighters, Hawkins is also an accomplished rock singer, guitarist and pianist. His first lead vocal with the group was a cover of Pink Floyd's "Have a Cigar". Two versions of the song were released, one as the b-side to "Learn to Fly" and another on the Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack album. He sang lead vocals on the original "Cold Day in the Sun," from In Your Honor, which was later released as a single, and the cover of Cream's "I Feel Free," which appeared as the b-side of "DOA" and on the EP Five Songs and a Cover. Hawkins also sang lead vocals for the band's cover of Joe Walsh's "Life of Illusion." Most recently, he sang lead vocals for "Sunday Rain," a track on the Foo Fighters' 2017 album Concrete and Gold. Many Foo Fighters live shows feature Hawkins singing lead vocals on at least one cover song. He now also contributes with songwriting, he co-wrote songs like "All My Life". </p>

				<h3> Personal Life </h3>
			</div>

			<div class="personalp">
				<p> Hawkins and his wife, Alison Hawkins, have three children. Their son, Oliver Shane, was born in 2006; their daughter, Annabelle, was born in winter, 2009; and their second daughter, Everleigh, was born in November 2014. <br>

				 </br> They reside in Hidden Hills, California after moving from Topanga Canyon in 2012. <br>

				</br> Hawkins overdosed on heroin in 2001, which put him in a coma for two weeks. Speaking to Beats 1 host Matt Wilkinson in 2018 about the incident, Hawkins said: "I was partying a lot. I wasn't a junkie per se, but I was partying. There was a year where the partying just got a little too heavy. Thank God on some level this guy gave me the wrong line with the wrong thing one night and I woke up going, 'What the fuck happened?' That was a real changing point for me." <br>

				</br> He is a childhood friend of current Yes lead vocalist Jon Davison. Hawkins was the one who suggested Davison to Yes bassist Chris Squire even before the departure of replacement vocalist Benoit David. "Strangely enough, Jon's name came up when we started working with Benoit," Squire recalled. "In fact, my friend, Taylor Hawkins, had been telling me for years: 'If you ever need a replacement (singer), I know exactly the guy." </p>
